## Welcome to my Personal GitHub Profile!

### About Me
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello! I'm @maucarrui (also known as Mauricio in the real world), and this is my
personal GitHub profile. Most of the projects you'll find here are related to my
time at university (I studied Computer Science at UNAM); research stays done at
the Applied Mathematics and Systems Research Institute (known as IIMAS in
Spanish), and the Center of Genomic Sciences (CCG in Spanish). The rest are for
personal, and/or educational purposes.

I'm a huge nerd when it comes to anything related to computers, more 
specifically: 
- Data Structures
- Algorithms Analysis
- Theory of Computation (Turing Machines and Automata)
- Graph Theory
- Distributed Systems
- Artificial Intelligence
- Natural Language Processing
- Information Theory
- Operating Systems

Not so much, right? Besides that I really like to spend my days researching
about text editors (a huge fan of Emacs and Vim). From color palettes for your
IDE (by the way, I love Nord Theme) to the most minute details about LSP 
(Language Server Protocol), spell checkers, and version control integrations 
(like Magit on Emacs).

### Technologies
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'm mostly proficient on Java and Python, but I also have experience with 
C/C++, Go, Haskell, JavaScript, PHP, and even some more obscure (and underrated)
languages like Racket! I'm also pretty good with LaTeX; however, this is mainly 
used to avoid working with programs like Microsoft Word and Google Docs, as this 
programs are not suited to write mathematical texts.

### Professional Life
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To be honest, I would really recommend checking my 
[LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maucarrui/) if you're interested 
in learning about my professional life. However, in summary, I've worked as a 
web developer (back-end and full-stack), as a research assistant (publishing 
several papers, and even participating in a book publication), and as a teaching
assistant (teaching Graph Theory and Linear Algebra courses at UNAM).

I'm interested in working in projects where we can keep learning, and improving
ourselves, where we thrive for elegant and efficient solutions to complex and
interesting problems.

### Contact
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The simplest and most effective way to contact me is by my e-mail:
`maucarrui@gmail.com`. I tend to take some time to answer, but I do respond.

Aside from my email, there is also my 
[LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/maucarrui/). This a more serious 
way to contact me, but all connections are welcomed.
